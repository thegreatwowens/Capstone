  _title: Front Panel and USB Connectors
  _content: Power connections for additional hardware like front panel audio and
    USB inputs are located in smaller, bare pin clusters. If you look closely at
    your motherboard, you'll find that each of these seemingly random motherboard
    connectors has an individual name either inside or alongside, detailing what
    the connector does. For example, you'll find front panel slots for your audio
    connectors, USB ports, and so on.
