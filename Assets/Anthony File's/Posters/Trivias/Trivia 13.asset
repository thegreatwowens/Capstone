  _title: FORTRAN
  _content: FORTRAN, short for "Formula Translation," was the first high-level programming
    language. It was developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering
    calculations. FORTRAN made programming more accessible by using English-like
    statements instead of machine code. Its introduction allowed programmers to write
    code that was more readable and efficient, making it easier to develop complex
    scientific applications. FORTRAN played a pivotal role in shaping the field of
    computer programming and remains in use today, albeit in evolved versions.
