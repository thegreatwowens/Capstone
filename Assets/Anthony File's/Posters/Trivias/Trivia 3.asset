  _title: The First Bug
  _content: The first computer bug, a moth, was discovered in 1947. While operating
    the Harvard Mark II computer, technicians found a moth trapped between relay
    contacts, causing a malfunction. The term "bug" was used to describe the issue,
    and the moth was carefully removed and taped into the computer's logbook. This
    incident coined the term "debugging" to refer to the process of fixing computer
    glitches. The preserved moth is now part of the collection at the Smithsonian
    Institution.
