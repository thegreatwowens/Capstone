  _title: The History of Computer
  _content: "At first theorized by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, during the 19th
    century mechanical calculating machines were designed and built to solve the
    increasingly complex number-crunching challenges. The advancement of technology
    enabled ever more-complex computers by the early 20th century, and computers
    became larger and more powerful.  Today, computers are almost unrecognizable
    from designs of the 19th century, such as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine
    \u2014 or even from the huge computers of the 20th century that occupied whole
    rooms, such as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator.    "
