  _content: Space will be the next frontier for cyber attackers. Satellites are vital
    elements of critical infrastructure. Wealthy and poor countries alike depend
    on them for communication, for the internet, for environmental monitoring and
    navigation. And, as the internet of things takes shape, our dependency on them
    will grow exponentially. On-board computers, designed to allow for remote configurations
    and upgrades to satellite systems, make them vulnerable to cyberattack. Many
    satellites are designed to have very long life cycles, so their technology will
    fall behind, creating serious legacy issues. The pace at which technology evolves
    will always make it hard, if not impossible, to find a timely response to space
    cyber-threats.
