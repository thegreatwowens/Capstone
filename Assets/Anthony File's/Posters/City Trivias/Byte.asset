  _content: Computer skills are necessary for employment in many of today's occupations.
    Years ago, only occupations such as system analyst, programmer, or data entry
    supervisor were expected to have computer skills prior to on-the-job training.
    Today's employer expects candidates to have developed a wide array of computer
    skills prior to employment. The more computer skills you learn, the more employable
    you become and the more flexibility you will have in your career planning.
