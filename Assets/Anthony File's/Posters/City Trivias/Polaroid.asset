  _content: 'A Polaroid camera is a type of camera with internal processing that
    produces a finished print rapidly after each photo is taken. So a camera prints
    a photo as soon as you take the photograph! The term, "polaroid" itself actually
    comes from one of the ingredients required to make instant photos. Polaroid is
    a plastic sheet with fancy chemicals on it that makes traditional film development
    unnecessary. So Polaroid is just a scientific term for the materials used to
    make instant pictures. '
