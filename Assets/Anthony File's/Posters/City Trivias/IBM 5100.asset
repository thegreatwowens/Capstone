  _content: The IBM 5100 Portable Computer is a portable computer (one of the first)
    introduced in September 1975. It can store more information than any other commercial
    machine (48,000 bits), contains a small display screen, and can be used as a
    terminal for the System/370. More 'luggable' than portable, it weighs 50 pounds
    and costs from $9,000 to $20,000. Though portable, it still needed to be plugged
    into an electric socket.
