  _title: Apple Evolution
  _content: Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The
    company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces. The
    high cost of its products caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and
    pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT. The company bought
    NeXT and enticed Jobs back to the company. Jobs guided Apple back to profitability
    through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and
    iPad to critical acclaim. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and
    died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
